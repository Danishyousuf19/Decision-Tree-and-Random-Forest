## Using Decision Tree Regressor and-Random Forest Regressor



This repository contains machine learning projects focused on various prediction tasks using Using Decision Tree Regressor and-Random Forest Regressor technique. Each project includes the dataset, a Jupyter notebook with the analysis and model implementation.

## Projects
 
1. **IMDb Indian Movies Rating Prediction**
   - **Description**: This project uses a dataset of IMDb Indian Movies Rating Prediction  to predict the Rating of a movie based on various factors.


## Getting Started

To run the projects locally, clone the repository and navigate to the respective project folder. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) to see the analysis and model implementation.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Danishyousuf19/K-Nearest-Neighbor-KNN.git](https://github.com/Danishyousuf19/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest.git)
